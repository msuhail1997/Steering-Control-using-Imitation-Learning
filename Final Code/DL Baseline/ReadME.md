## Deep Learning Baseline model for Domain Adaptation
1) Download Track2 (Jungle) dataset from the link provided in data README.md.
   
2) Add the folder path containing the IMG Folder and log file in the 'data_dir' part of the parser.
   
3) Run train.py "-$python3 train.py" in terminal to train the model.
   
4) Download the Simulator using the link given in data README.md file
 
5) Run the command'-$ python3 drive.py modeltrack2-random-4000.h5' to start the trained model.
  
6) Open the Simulator and open 'track 1' environment in Autonomous mode to visualize the performance of the model.
